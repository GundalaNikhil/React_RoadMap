Life Cycle of Class Components

Now, let's explain the class component lifecycle in detail:

Constructor: This is where the component is initialized. You set the initial state and bind methods here.

render: This method returns the JSX that will be displayed.

componentDidMount: This lifecycle method is called immediately after the component is inserted into the DOM. It's a good place for side effects like data fetching or DOM manipulation.

State or Props Change: When the state or props of a component change, it triggers an update.

componentDidUpdate: This lifecycle method is called immediately after the component's state or props change. It 's a good place for side effects like data fetching or DOM manipulation.

shouldComponentUpdate: This method allows you to optimize performance by deciding if a re-render is necessary.

render (again): If an update is needed, the component re-renders.

componentDidUpdate: This method is called after the update is committed to the DOM. It's useful for additional side effects.

componentWillUnmount: This is called just before the component is removed from the DOM. It's used for cleanup (like removing event listeners).
